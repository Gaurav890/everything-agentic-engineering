### 2026-07-25 — T-001

**Requirements:** FR-001
**Acceptance:** AC-001
**Outcome:** PARTIAL

**Change**

Added the phase-based product-design router and local phase contracts; demoted
Anthropic frontend-design to optional supplementary intelligence; added the
product-specific design-system contract and DTCG-compatible token scaffold.

**Evidence**

- All project-local skills pass `quick_validate.py`.
- `./scripts/verify.sh full` passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.

**Commit/PR**

Branch: `feat/T-001-product-design-engine`; commit and PR pending final review.

**Remaining risk**

The scaffold has no platform token build/export pipeline yet. External phase
skills remain optional installations and must be reviewed before use.
